# Sequencing Animations Project

## Overview

This project is all about making a webpage more exciting by adding cool animations. Imagine images rotating and shrinking in a sequence, creating a visually appealing experience. We're using some techy stuff like the Web Animations API and Promises in JavaScript to make it happen. It's like choreographing a dance but for images on a webpage!
